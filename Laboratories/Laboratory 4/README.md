# Databases Pt. 2

## Adding the Database Relations

:bulb: Do a similar setup as in Laboratory 3, but with a different database to avoid problems with migrations.

Right-click on the folder `Models`, then add the following folders and files:

- `One-to-Many`:
  - `Model1.cs`
  - `Model2.cs`
- `Many-to-Many`:
  - `Model3.cs`
  - `Model4.cs`
- `One-to-One`:
  - `Model5.cs`
  - `Model6.cs`
